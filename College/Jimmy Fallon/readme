This program was created to simulate buying tickets to a Jimmy Fallon show with callers calling a certain number of operators 
for the show all at once to buy a limited number of tickets 


The program starts by declaring semiphores globally
Then in main it creates an array of 240 pthreads and initializes them in a for loop
the a later for loop waits for them all to finish
The phone call method increments the caller's id and checks to see if there is a line available
If not it waits till one is
When one is availible it allows the caller to wait for an operator and increments connected
When an operator is free the client orders their ticket in 1 second and then exits and deincrements connected
This continues until all calls are finished.
